# Google Books Search App

This React-based application allows a user to search for and save Google books of interest.  When a user first visits the application, they have the ability to search for a book of choice.  The Google book API will output a list of books relevant to the query.  The user can then view more about the book in detail through the Google API, or they can save a book to their _Saved Books_ list.  Lastly, the user can view their selected books and choose to view the book in detail or delete from their saved list.
